# Envronment Boilerplate

Envronment Boilerplate gives us a simple and modern way to create WebVR applications using [A-FRAME](https://aframe.io/), the Mozilla's web framework for building virtual reality experiences. The boilerplate uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) so you are able to write ES6 and make your code reusable.
